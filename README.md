# TicTacToe 2x2 Game
The Game is developed in Python. 
A 2x2 is not Challenging from any Perspective. Even 3x3 is not Challanging enough. 
Still we made it, just for Fun, and for Learning Purposes!

The _**Override**_ is Allowed. This made it look like a Game. 

### The Goal
In order to Win, you have to Occupy Three Places. 
The First Player to Occupy any of the Three Places, would Win. 

#### A Small Alert
With the Override allowed, the Game _could_ go on forever; Neither you nor the CPU would be able to occupy Three Places. 
But don't worry, we have not made the CPU that much clever yet. So this won't happen. 
In fact, the CPU would play like a Child. So **No Fears, No Tears**. 

Enjoy!
